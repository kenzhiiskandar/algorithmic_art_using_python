# algorithmic_art_using_python

## Description
This program is part of a school project, aims to create an algorithmic pattern design using python's turtle module. The program consists of three different patterns.

Each pattern is enclosed by a square or a circle. The program gives the users preference to choose which pattern they want to display: all the three-patterns, one pattern only, or exactly two patterns. The program allows the user to choose their preference colors.

## User's Manual
There are three sections on this manual: display all the three patterns, display only one pattern, and display exactly two patterns.  
Install turtle's python library before proceeding
   ```sh
   pip3 install PythonTurtle
   ```

### Display all the three patterns
1.	Run the program.  
2.	You will be asked to input the file. Type in “Data1.txt” without the quotation marks.  
3.	Wait the program to run. It takes time.
5.	You may change the colors as you like by opening the “Data1.txt” file on your folder.  
6.	The first 6 lines of “Data1.txt” are the original colors of the program. You may change them as you like.  
7.	Please note that your input color should be available in python turtle module, and do not create a new blank line as the program will read errors. Here is another sample output with different colors.  
8.	The next lines after the sixth line are the coordinates of each pattern. The first term is the x-coordinate and the second term is the y-coordinate of each pattern. Line 7 is for Pattern 1, Line 8 is for Pattern 2, Line 9 is for Pattern 3, and it iterates as mentioned until the final line.  
8.	You may change the position of a particular pattern by changing the coordinates. But do not create a blank line.

### Display one pattern only
1.	The program allows you to display exactly one pattern (refer to the pattern picture at the top).  
2.	Run the program.  
3.	You will be asked to input the file name. Type in “Data2.txt” without quotation marks.  
4.	Wait the program to run. It takes time.  
5.	You may change the color as you like by editing the file “Data2.txt” on line 1-4.   
6.	Line 5 is the pattern you want the program to display, whether it is “Pattern_1”, “Pattern_2”, or “Pattern_3”. To change the pattern you would like to display, simply edit the text “Pattern_3” and change it to “Pattern_1” or “Pattern_2”.  
7.	The next lines after line 5 is the coordinates of each pattern generated by for loops.

### Display Exactly Two Patterns
1.	Run the program.  
2.	You will be asked to input the file name. Type in “Data3.txt” without quotation marks.  
3.	Wait the program to run. It takes time.  
4.	You may change the colors as you wish by opening “Data3.txt” file and editing line 1-5.  
5.	You may change which two patterns out of three you wish to display, by editing the pattern number on line 6-7. The program provides three kind of patterns: Pattern_1, Pattern_2, and Pattern_3. Simply just type in what pattern you would like to display on that space.  
6.	The next lines are the coordinate of each pattern repeatedly.
